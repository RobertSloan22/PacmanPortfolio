Pacman
This project is a simple web application that allows the user to interact with a Pacman character on the screen. The application consists of a page with two buttons that allow the user to start the game and add new Pacman characters to the screen.

Getting Started
To run the Pacman application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

Usage
Once the application is open in your web browser, you will see two buttons on the screen:

Start Game: Clicking this button will start the Pacman moving on the page. The Pacman will move back and forth across the screen.

Add Pacman: Clicking this button will add a new Pacman character to the screen. You can add as many Pacman characters as you like by clicking this button multiple times.
